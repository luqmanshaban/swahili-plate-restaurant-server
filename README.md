# Introducing Swahili Plate: A Full-Stack Website for a Nairobi-based Restaurant

Swahili Plate is a well-known restaurant in Nairobi, renowned for its delicious Swahili cuisine. The restaurant has been operating for several years, and despite its popularity, it lacked an online presence. That's where I came in. As a developer, I was tasked with creating a full-stack website for Swahili Plate that would help the restaurant expand its reach and engage with its customers in a more meaningful way.

The primary objective of the project was to create a user-friendly and responsive website that would showcase the restaurant's menu, provide customers with a seamless online ordering experience, and enable the restaurant's management team to manage orders, menus, and customer data with ease. To achieve this, I chose to use a combination of front-end and back-end technologies that are widely used and well-suited for this type of project.

## Front-end Development

The front-end of the Swahili Plate website is built using the following technologies:

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- MUI: A UI framework that makes it easy to create responsive designs.
- SASS: A powerful CSS extension language for styling.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for layout and additional styling.

The website's front-end is designed to be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and accessible on a range of devices.

## Back-end Development

The back-end of the website is built using the following technologies:

- Laravel: A PHP web application framework that provides a clean and elegant syntax while offering robust features for web development.
- Laravel ORM (Eloquent): A powerful object-relational mapping (ORM) system provided by Laravel, which allows developers to interact with databases using PHP.
- MySQL: A widely used relational database management system that is easy to use and scalable.

These technologies were used to build the server-side functionality of the website, which includes order management, menu updates, and customer data management.

## Version Control

To ensure that the project is well-organized and easy to maintain, I chose to use Git for version control. Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, track changes, and collaborate more efficiently. By using Git, I was able to create branches for different features and merge changes seamlessly, without affecting the stability of the website.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, building the Swahili Plate website was an exciting and challenging project that allowed me to use a range of front-end and back-end technologies to create a user-friendly and responsive website for a Nairobi-based restaurant. By using React, JavaScript, MUI, SASS, CSS, Laravel, Laravel ORM, MySQL, and Git, I was able to create a website that met the client's needs, improved the restaurant's online presence, and provided customers with a seamless online ordering experience. I am proud of the outcome of this project and believe it will go a long way in helping Swahili Plate grow and thrive in the years to come.
